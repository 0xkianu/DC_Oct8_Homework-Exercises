                If you happen to be playing a game where you are looking for words while driving or doing other activities, you can use the tool so that the letter you choose is completely random. For example, you may play a game where you say or write down as many things as you can see starting with a specific letter, and this tool will determine what that letter is for each round.
                While this is a simple tool, it's a great way to test your basic understanding of each language when you first begin to learn and begin to write and read it. The more you practice, the quicker you'll master each of the alphabets.
                The above are just a few ideas on how this tool can be used and there are surely a lot more ways individuals can incorporate this tool for their needs. We always try to make our tools as useful as possible. If there's another language you would like to see included as part of the Random Letter Generator, feel free to contact to let us know and we'll try to add it.
